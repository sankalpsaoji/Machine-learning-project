# Machine learning project
 Comparing the accuracies of two machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines to three-layer neural network for  classification of people survived or not survived on the titanic dataset.
 
 Thus, to conclude we can say that for this research project we have successfully implemented neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) models for classification using titanic dataset and would like conclude that SVM has slightly outperformed neural networks. The reason behind can be that neural networks requires large training data to perform efficiently. Therefore, SVM supported to be a better classifier on titanic data for this project.
 
 For future work we can up sample the training dataset for more accuracy as data is very small for neural networks to train properly and we can also tune more hyper parameters, add numbers of layers in neural networks and in other case boosting can also be used to reduce error rate.
